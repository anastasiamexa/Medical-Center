# Medical-Center
A web application to manage regular medical appointments in a diagnostic center.

As part of the course "Current topics of software engineering - Software for mobile devices", we developed a web application called Medical Center.

## Features for patients
- Patients can log into their account.
- Search for an available appointment for an examination by a doctor of specific specialty.
- Arrange an appointment (on an available free date/time) with a specific doctor.
- Cancel a future appointment.
- View history of previous appointments.

## Features for doctors
- Doctors can log into their account.
- Registration of availability (dates/times accepting appointments).
- View the specific doctor's appointment schedule (per day and per week).
- Cancel a future appointment.

## Features for admins
- Registration of doctors and patients in the system.

## Tech
For this application we used the Visual Studio environment using ASP.NET Core MVC technology. The database used is Microsoft SQL Server.
